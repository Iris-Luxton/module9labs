Practice MongoDB: (using the term COLLECTION)
- Need comment
- Need user
- Need post
MongoDB is more flexible as it can have comment right under the post - each post will have one comment (or more)
It is like we dump our shit into the garage


Practice MySQL: (using the term TABLE, column is property and row is data)
- There can be multiple comments for each post but we have to group them in a separate place
- There is restriction: user collection will only have user data
(unlike MongoDB where we can store the comment at the same location as the post --> dumping data as collections)
